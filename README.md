# PracticeGherkinPython
This is a practice tool I've created in order to allow individuals to write basic Gherkin in python!

WARNING: 
Where the naming conventions of individual Python files and folders may make the tool seem like a compiler, it breaks from almost all norms. It cannot be treated as one because, fundamentally, it is not.
